Below you will see the LeetCode task and my solution in Kotlin.
Do the following:
1. Convert my solution to Java. Do not add imports and comments to the code.
2. Convert the solution to C++. Do not add includes, comments, and the std:: prefix
3. Convert the solution to Python 3. Do not add imports and comments to the code.
4. Create a title for publishing my solution using the following template. Don't remove spaces before "Kotlin" and after "Python".
```markdown
[ Kotlin | Java | C++ | Python ] Simple <technique> solution, detailed explanation
```
Replace <technique> to main solution technique, for example: Sorting, DP, Caching, DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, DSU, Backtracking, Two Pointers, etc.
5. Create a description of my solution using the following Markdown template. Create it as artifact and show it on the right side. Use $$ $$ markdown for complexity, for example: $$O(n)$$.
```markdown
# Intuition
<!-- Describe thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

# Approach
<!-- Describe approach to solving the problem. -->

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```kotlin []
// Insert my Kotlin code
```

```java []
// Insert the converted Java code
```

```cpp []
// Insert the converted C++ code
```

```python3 []
# Insert the converted Python 3 code
```
```
Remove <!-- --> comments.
There is no need to rewrite my original solution. I am confident in it, as I tested it on LeetCode and got Accepted.
